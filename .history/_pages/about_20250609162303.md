<div id="about-me"></div>

I am a PhD applicant from Shanghai Jiao Tong University with a strong background in robotic perception, path planning, and odor source localization. I hold a B.S. degree in Environmental Science and Engineering, and I have actively contributed to projects involving UAV-based gas source tracking, deep reinforcement learning, and intelligent sensor systems. My research integrates machine learning, control systems, and environmental sensing, aiming to build intelligent robotic systems for environmental applications.

My research interests include reinforcement learning, Transformer architectures, and robotics. I have published in IEEE ECIS and am preparing a manuscript for submission to *Environmental Science & Technology*.
