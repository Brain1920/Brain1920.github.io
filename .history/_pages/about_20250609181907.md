<div id="about-me" style="padding-top: -40px;"></div>

I am a PhD applicant from Shanghai Jiao Tong University with a strong background in robotic perception, path planning, and odor source localization. I hold a B.S. degree in Environmental Science and Engineering. After graduation, I joined Professor Zehui Li's research group at Shanghai Jiao Tong University and TC Air Limited. I primarily contributed to projects involving UAV-based gas source tracking and intelligent sensor systems, where my research integrated deep reinforcement learning, robotic operating systems, and environmental perception.


My research interests focus on the intersection of artificial intelligence and robotics, with the goal of developing intelligent robotic systems that can autonomously perceive, interact with, and adapt to their environment. These systems are designed for real-world applications such as autonomous decision-making, sensor-based systems, and collaborative robotics in dynamic environments. By bridging the gap between AI and robotics, my work enables robots to learn and adapt in complex scenarios. I have published a paper in IEEE ECIS, and another paper on UAV hardware is currently under review.
