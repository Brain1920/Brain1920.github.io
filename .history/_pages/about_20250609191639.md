<div id="about-me" style="padding-top: -40px;"></div>

I am a **PhD applicant** from Shanghai Jiao Tong University with a strong background in **robotic perception, path planning, and odor source localization**. I hold a B.S. degree in Environmental Science and Engineering. After graduation, I joined Professor Zehui Li's research group at Shanghai Jiao Tong University and TC Air Limited. I primarily contributed to projects involving UAV-based gas source tracking and intelligent sensor systems, where my research integrated deep reinforcement learning, robotic operating systems, and environmental perception.


My research interests focus on the intersection of **artificial intelligence and robotics**, with the goal of developing intelligent robotic systems that can autonomously perceive, interact with, and adapt to their environment. These systems are designed for real-world applications such as autonomous decision-making, sensor-based systems, and collaborative robotics in dynamic environments. By bridging the gap between AI and robotics, my work enables robots to learn and adapt in complex scenarios. I have published a paper in IEEE ECIS, and another paper on UAV hardware is currently under review.
